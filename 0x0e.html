				<p>
					I am bad at naming things.
		<br>
		I am.
		<br>
		It's just a fact of life.
		<br>
		The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s, the sun will inevitably die, Earth will soon crumble due to human pollution,
		<br>
		California has shitty gas prices, and I... am bad at naming things.
		<br>
		<br>
		To cut to the chase, I've had several projects I've had to rename in the past.
		<br>
		Some more than once. But my most recent project, <i>mxfw</i>, has been renamed five times.
		<br>
		It started out as Opal, then Moonstone, Carbon, Sodium--eventually I just quit trying.
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>mxfw</i> as it is referred to right now, is a framework window manager for macOS. If you live in *nix land or use
		<br>
		X11, think awesome wm but for macOS.
		<br>
		It's been renamed five times. That's ridiculous. It started out as Opal simply because that was the first thing I thought of.
		<br>
		It moved to Moonstone because it uses Lua as its scripting language. I thought it made sense.
		<br>
		Eventually I wasn't a fan of that name because it seemed long and to some degree unmemorable.
		<br>
		Then came Carbon. Users complained that it was called Carbon because Apple already has a library they call Carbon.
		<br>
		For some that was too confusing. Then came Sodium. Turns out, there's a Minecraft mod named Sodium.
		<br>
		The elements theme was because it was supposed to be the building block for a window manager.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the past I've named projects after a quality they have, and if not that, then the first thing that came to mind.
		<br>
		<a href="https://github.com/Sweets/hummingbird" target="_blank">hummingbird</a> was named because hummingbirds are fast, and it's
		<br>
		entire design philosophy is to be a fast init for Linux.
		<br>
		<a href="https://github.com/Sweets/tiramisu" target="_blank">tiramisu</a> was named because I was eating tiramisu at the time I created it.
		<br>
		<br>
		I'm a simple man.<br>
		But alas, a simple man cannot name things. Not that you would expect me to be able to--I'm named after a color.
