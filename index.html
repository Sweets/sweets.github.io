				So this is my "blog" of sorts. A little about me, about the work I do, my system, etc.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm Grayson, I go by Sweets on the internet. I'm 20 years old, born in Texas, I now live in California.
				<br>
				My background is in full stack web development, though now I don't work as a developer, I'm just a lowly C hobbyist.
				<br>
				Now I work as a microminiature repair technician. I solder super tiny circuits and shit.
				<br>
				<br>
				I believe in clean, readable code. I'm known for a various projects in *nix communities, <a href="https://github.com/Sweets/tiramisu" target="_blank">tiramisu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Sweets/hummingbird" target="_blank">hummingbird</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/comfies/custard" target="_blank">custard</a> just to name a few.
				<br>
				<br>
				Some information on my system, my desktop is a custom build.
				<br>
				I've got a Ryzen 9 3950x, an RTX 2070 Super, Sabrent Rocket Q4 4TB, an Asus Strix B550-I, all housed within a beautiful <a href="https://formdworks.com/products/t1" target="=_blank">formd T1</a>.<br>
				My primary operating system is Windows 10, which is where I do all of my development. And yes, I see the irony in that.
				<br>
				When I do use Linux, I use <a href="https://k1sslinux.org" target="=_blank">kiss linux</a> and <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">debian</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
 				Some communities that I frequent are r/<a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn" target="_blank">unixporn</a> and r/<a href="https://reddit.com/r/sffpc" target="_blank">sffpc</a>.
