			<h3><span>0x03</span> &mdash; <i>help, i'm lost in walmart</i></h3>
			<p>
				After some bouncing of domains off of the forehead of a certain box, I've finally decided on what I want to call my blog.
				<br>
				A common tagline I've used on various social medias is "Help, I'm lost in Walmart."
				<br>
				This mostly stems from my inability to think up bios and such, but it's stuck for quite some time.
				<br>
				<br>
				So what better to call my blog than the lost in walmart blog? My blog isn't strictly tech related, just a blog for me to write whatever comes to me.
				<br>
				<br>
				So officially; <i>help, I'm lost in Walmart</i>.
				<br>
				<br>
				On another note, you may notice in the top right a "previous" and "next" button.
				<br>
				The lost in walmart blog is part of a webcircle, the links go to various sites of my friends, and at some point, back here eventually.
				<br>
				Check out the other sites in the circle, I'm sure something that piques your interest can be found.

			<h3><span>0x02</span> &mdash; <i>__always_inline, linux, and musl</i></h3>
			<p>
				If you're trying to install <a href="https://k1sslinux.org" target="_blank">kiss linux</a> (or any non-glibc distribution) with a linux 5.x kernel, you may find that you'll run into an error trying to build the kernel.
			</p>
			<pre>/usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h:44:8: error: unknown type name '__always_inline'</pre>
			<p>
				On a system running glibc, this isn't particularly an issue; __always_inline is defined.
				<br>
				This isn't the case on systems that are using <a href="https://www.musl-libc.org/" target="_blank">musl</a> or other libc's though.
				<br>
				<br>
				So, as a quick fix, open up /usr/include/linux/swab.h in your flavor of text editor, and include linux/stddef.h just below linux/types.h.
			</p>
			<pre>#include &lt;linux/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;linux/stddef.h&gt;</pre>
			<p>
				With that, try to build again and you should be up an running.
				<br>
				Several PRs have been made in regards to this issue, so hopefully this will be fixed soon.

			<p>
				So this is my "blog" of sorts. A little about me, about the work I do, my system, etc.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'm Grayson, I go by Sweets on the internet. I'm 20 years old, born in Texas, I now live in California.
				<br>
				My background is in full stack web development, though now I don't work as a developer, I'm just a lowly C hobbyist.
				<br>
				Now I work as a microminiature repair technician. I solder super tiny circuits and shit.
				<br>
				<br>
				I believe in clean, readable code. I'm known for a various projects in *nix communities, <a href="https://github.com/Sweets/tiramisu" target="_blank">tiramisu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Sweets/hummingbird" target="_blank">hummingbird</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/comfies/custard" target="_blank">custard</a> just to name a few.
				<br>
				<br>
				Some information on my system, my desktop is a custom build.
				<br>
				I've got a Ryzen 9 3950x @ 4.5GHz, an RTX 2070 Super, 2x8GB T-Force XTREEM (14-15-11-21@3600MHz), Sabrent Rocket Q4 4TB, an Asus Strix B550-I, all housed within a beautiful <a href="https://formdworks.com/products/t1" target="=_blank">formd T1</a>.<br>
				My primary operating system is Windows 10, which is where I do all of my development. And yes, I see the irony in that.
				<br>
				When I do use Linux, I use <a href="https://k1sslinux.org" target="=_blank">kiss linux</a> and <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">debian</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
 				Some communities that I frequent are r/<a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn" target="_blank">unixporn</a> and r/<a href="https://reddit.com/r/sffpc" target="_blank">sffpc</a>.
